# The Mindustry batch launcher

Hey, it's me, @Lameur, the creator of this win batch launcher.
Am really happy that you download this, it was a challenge for me.

But I have few information to give :

1. The release version of Mindustry can't be update with this script, so if you want update, prefer to use the itch desktop app that can be downloads at <https://itch.io/app>.
2. You can download mod, if you place it at the "mods" folder and then execute "mod install", the mod will be installed.
3. DO NOT DELETE THE DATA FOLDER, THAT THE FOLDER THAT CONTAIN THE BATCH FILE.
4. DO NOT PLACE THE FOLDERS IN TEMP, SYSTEM OR OTHER LIKE THAT FOLDERS.
