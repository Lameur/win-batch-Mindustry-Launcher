# The Mindustry batch launcher

[lameur]: https://github.com/lameur
Hey, it's me, [@Lameur][lameur], the creator of this win batch launcher.
Am really happy that you download this, it was a challenge for me.

But I have few information to give :

1. The release version of Mindustry can't be update with this script, so if you want update, prefer to use the itch desktop app that can be downloads [here](https://itch.io/app).
2. You can download mod in github (or use steam cmd to retrive content?), if you place it at the "mods" folder and then execute "mod install", the mod will be installed (but prefer the in-game mods downloader, it's eazy, it automatically updates the mods and it save to search trought github).
3. Mods backup can be used to eazy share mods but it not automatically updates the mods (see the point 2).
4. DO NOT DELETE THE "DATA" FOLDER, THAT THE FOLDER THAT CONTAIN THE BATCH FILE.
5. DO NOT PLACE THE FOLDERS IN "TEMP", "SYSTEM" OR OTHER LIKE THAT FOLDERS.
